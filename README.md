# acorn

Turns GitHub issues into agent-ready implementation specs.

Ideas start small. Acorn grows them into something an agent can build.

## What It Does

Acorn takes a GitHub issue and runs it through a multi-agent planning pipeline to produce a detailed implementation specification (`SPEC.md`). Three pipeline modes let you trade thoroughness for speed:

| Mode | Flag | Stages | Agents | Recon Model | Planning Model | Best For |
|------|------|--------|--------|-------------|----------------|----------|
| Full | _(default)_ | 6 | 14 | Opus | Opus | Complex features, architectural decisions |
| Lite | `--lite` | 4 | 6 | Sonnet | Opus | Standard features, moderate complexity |
| Quick | `--quick` | 2 | 4 | Sonnet | Opus | Simple features, time-sensitive changes |

All modes ground planning in actual codebase reconnaissance. The difference is how many competing drafts, evaluations, and adversarial reviews are performed.

## Workflows

Acorn covers the full lifecycle from rough idea to running implementation. You can enter at any point.

### Idea to Issue

You have a vague idea — "we need better error handling" or "add dark mode". The `/acorn-issue-craft` skill walks you through a conversational refinement process: it draws out requirements, pushes back on vagueness, structures everything into a JTBD (Jobs to Be Done) template with Job Story, Promise, Constraints, and Acceptance Criteria, then creates the GitHub issue via `acorn issue create`.

```
"I want to add notifications" → /acorn-issue-craft → structured GitHub issue
```

### Issue to Spec

You have a well-defined GitHub issue. `acorn create` fetches it, downloads any images, and launches a multi-agent planning pipeline that produces `SPEC.md`.

```
acorn create myapp 42 [--lite | --quick]
```

### Spec to Implementation

Acorn's responsibility ends at spec approval (`acorn approve`). The `/acorn-spec-review` skill evaluates the spec across completeness, feasibility, and alignment dimensions, then runs `acorn approve`. Implementation handoff is optional and uses [cashew](https://github.com/andrewxhill/cashew)'s `dev` commands (`dev wt`, `dev <repo>/<branch>/pi`) to create worktrees and dispatch agents — this is cashew's domain, not acorn's.

```
/acorn-spec-review → review → acorn approve → [cashew: dev wt + agent dispatch]
```

### Batch Processing

Multiple issues to process? `/acorn-orchestrate` analyzes dependencies between issues, groups them into parallelizable waves, selects the right pipeline mode for each issue's complexity, and coordinates batch spec generation.

```
/acorn-orchestrate → dependency analysis → wave ordering → parallel spec generation
```

**The pipeline:**

```
GitHub Issue
    |
    v
acorn create <repo> <issue#> [--lite | --quick]
    |-- Fetches issue (title, body, comments)
    |-- Downloads any images from the issue to .specs/<slug>/images/
    |-- Generates PROMPT.md with requirements + planning methodology
    |   (image URLs rewritten to local paths for agent visibility)
    |-- Sets GitHub label: spec-in-progress
    |-- (Issues created via `acorn issue create` start at `triage`)
    |-- Starts a detached Claude Code session in tmux
    |
    v
Multi-Agent Planning (mode-dependent)
    |
    v
acorn approve <repo> <slug>
    |-- Verifies SPEC.md exists
    |-- Sets GitHub label: spec-approved
```

## Dependencies

Install these before using Acorn:

| Dependency | Purpose | Install |
|------------|---------|---------|
| **gh** | GitHub CLI — fetches issues, manages labels, posts comments | `brew install gh` then `gh auth login` |
| **jq** | JSON parsing | `brew install jq` |
| **tmux** | Session management for detached agent sessions | `brew install tmux` |
| **claude** | Claude Code CLI — runs the planning pipeline | See [Claude Code docs](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) |
| **curl** | Downloads images from GitHub issues | Pre-installed on macOS and most Linux |

On Linux, replace `brew install` with your package manager (e.g., `apt install gh jq tmux`).

### Verify dependencies

```bash
gh --version
jq --version
tmux -V
claude --version
```

### GitHub authentication

Acorn uses `gh` for all GitHub operations. You must be authenticated:

```bash
gh auth login
gh auth status   # confirm you're logged in
```

## Installation

### Easiest: `/acorn-setup` skill

If you already have the repo cloned and Claude Code running, invoke `/acorn-setup` — it handles the binary symlink, global config, commands, skills, and git remote in one go.

### With Cashew (recommended)

If you already have [cashew](https://github.com/andrewxhill/cashew) installed, `dev` is already in place. Just add acorn:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:craigmmills/acorn.git
ln -s "$(pwd)/acorn/bin/acorn" /usr/local/bin/acorn

# Register /acorn command with Claude Code
ln -sf "$(pwd)/acorn/claude/commands/acorn.md" ~/.claude/commands/acorn.md

# Install Claude Code skills
ln -sf "$(pwd)/acorn/.claude/skills/setup" ~/.claude/skills/acorn-setup
ln -sf "$(pwd)/acorn/.claude/skills/orchestrate" ~/.claude/skills/acorn-orchestrate
ln -sf "$(pwd)/acorn/.claude/skills/issue-craft" ~/.claude/skills/acorn-issue-craft
ln -sf "$(pwd)/acorn/.claude/skills/spec-review" ~/.claude/skills/acorn-spec-review

# Append acorn global context to Claude config (idempotent)
if ! grep -q "BEGIN ACORN GLOBAL CONTEXT" ~/.claude/CLAUDE.md 2>/dev/null; then
  { echo ""; echo "<!-- BEGIN ACORN GLOBAL CONTEXT -->"; cat "$(pwd)/acorn/claude/global/CLAUDE.md"; echo "<!-- END ACORN GLOBAL CONTEXT -->"; } >> ~/.claude/CLAUDE.md
fi

acorn --help
```

### Standalone (without Cashew)

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone git@github.com:craigmmills/acorn.git

# Add to your PATH (pick one)

# Option A: Symlink into a directory already on your PATH
ln -s "$(pwd)/acorn/bin/acorn" /usr/local/bin/acorn

# Option B: Add to PATH in your shell profile (~/.zshrc or ~/.bashrc)
export PATH="$HOME/path/to/acorn/bin:$PATH"

# Register /acorn command with Claude Code
mkdir -p ~/.claude/commands
ln -sf "$(pwd)/acorn/claude/commands/acorn.md" ~/.claude/commands/acorn.md

# Install Claude Code skills
mkdir -p ~/.claude/skills
ln -sf "$(pwd)/acorn/.claude/skills/setup" ~/.claude/skills/acorn-setup
ln -sf "$(pwd)/acorn/.claude/skills/orchestrate" ~/.claude/skills/acorn-orchestrate
ln -sf "$(pwd)/acorn/.claude/skills/issue-craft" ~/.claude/skills/acorn-issue-craft
ln -sf "$(pwd)/acorn/.claude/skills/spec-review" ~/.claude/skills/acorn-spec-review

# Append acorn global context to Claude config (idempotent)
if ! grep -q "BEGIN ACORN GLOBAL CONTEXT" ~/.claude/CLAUDE.md 2>/dev/null; then
  { echo ""; echo "<!-- BEGIN ACORN GLOBAL CONTEXT -->"; cat "$(pwd)/acorn/claude/global/CLAUDE.md"; echo "<!-- END ACORN GLOBAL CONTEXT -->"; } >> ~/.claude/CLAUDE.md
fi
```

### Verify installation

```bash
acorn --help
claude --version
grep "ACORN GLOBAL CONTEXT" ~/.claude/CLAUDE.md
ls -la ~/.claude/skills/acorn-*
```

### Cashew compatibility

Acorn is designed to work alongside cashew's `dev` session manager:

- **Project layout**: Both use `~/Projects/<repo>/main/` (auto-detects `~/Projects` or `~/projects`)
- **Sessions**: Acorn creates tmux sessions named `<repo>_specs_<slug>_claude` — these show up in `dev` session listings
- **No conflicts**: Acorn's `.specs/` directory lives inside `main/` and doesn't interfere with cashew worktrees

## Claude Code Skills

Acorn ships four Claude Code skills that extend its capabilities beyond the CLI:

| Skill | Trigger | Purpose |
|-------|---------|---------|
| `/acorn-setup` | "set up acorn", "install acorn" | Bootstrap the full acorn installation (binary, config, skills, git remote) |
| `/acorn-issue-craft` | "I want to add...", "create an issue for..." | Conversational refinement of rough ideas into structured JTBD issues |
| `/acorn-orchestrate` | "spec the ready-for-spec issues", "batch spec" | Multi-issue pipeline with dependency analysis, wave ordering, and mode selection |
| `/acorn-spec-review` | "review this spec", "approve and implement" | Spec quality review across completeness/feasibility/alignment + implementation handoff |

Skills are installed as symlinks to the repo (see Installation) and are available in any Claude Code session.

## Project Layout Convention

Acorn expects your projects to live at `~/Projects/<repo>/main/` (or `~/projects/<repo>/main/`). This is the directory where `gh` commands run and where `.specs/` directories are created.

```
~/Projects/
  myapp/
    main/              <-- repo checkout (acorn operates here)
      .specs/          <-- created by acorn
        42-add-auth/
          PROMPT.md    <-- generated requirements + planning methodology
          meta.json    <-- metadata (repo, issue, session info, mode)
          images/      <-- downloaded images from the GitHub issue
            <hash>.png   (auto-downloaded, referenced in PROMPT.md)
          recon/                        Full  Lite  Quick
            architecture.md              Y     Y     Y
            relevant_code.md             Y     Y     Y
            conventions.md               Y     Y     Y
          plans/
            draft_plan_1..4.md           Y     -     -
            draft.md                     -     Y     -
            evaluation.md                Y     -     -
            master_plan.md               Y     -     -
            validation.md                -     Y     -
            red_team_1..4.md             Y     -     -
            SPEC.md                      Y     Y     Y
```

## Usage

### Create a spec from a GitHub issue

```bash
# Full pipeline (default) — 14 agents, 6 stages
acorn create myapp 42

# Lite pipeline — 6 agents, 4 stages
acorn create myapp 42 --lite

# Quick pipeline — 4 agents, 2 stages
acorn create myapp 42 --quick
```

This will:
1. Fetch issue #42 from the `myapp` repo
2. Generate a slug (e.g., `42-add-authentication`)
3. Create `.specs/42-add-authentication/PROMPT.md` with full requirements and planning instructions
4. Create lifecycle labels on the repo if they don't exist
5. Set the issue label to `spec-in-progress`
6. Post a comment on the issue with the spec location
7. Start a detached tmux session with Claude Code
8. Automatically trigger the planning pipeline once Claude Code is ready

Monitor or attach anytime:

```bash
# Attach to the session (session name is printed by acorn create)
tmux attach -t <session-name>
```

To opt out of auto-triggering:

```bash
acorn create myapp 42 --no-auto
```

### List all specs

```bash
# List specs across all repos
acorn list

# List specs for a specific repo
acorn list myapp
```

Output shows repo, issue number, slug, status, mode, age, clarification status, and path.

**Status values:**
- Actual lifecycle label from GitHub when present (`triage`, `ready-for-spec`, `spec-in-progress`, `spec-review`, `spec-approved`, `implementing`, `in-review`, `done`)
- Legacy fallback for unlabeled issues:
  - `planning` — PROMPT.md exists, agent is working
  - `review` — plans/SPEC.md exists, ready for human review
  - `unknown` — spec directory exists but state is unclear

### Failure handling

Acorn validates stage artifacts before stage advance via `acorn _internal validate-stage` instructions embedded in PROMPT.md.
If a sub-agent fails to produce expected artifacts, orchestrators retry failed agent(s) with backoff.
Defaults are `ACORN_SUBAGENT_RETRY_BUDGET=1` and `ACORN_SUBAGENT_RETRY_BACKOFF_SECONDS=30`.
On retry exhaustion, the pipeline halts and writes `HALT.md` under `.specs/<slug>/recon/` (stage 0) or `.specs/<slug>/plans/` (later stages).
Set `ACORN_FAILURE_EVENT_PATH=/path/to/events.jsonl` to append machine-readable `subagent.halt` JSONL events.

### Session dashboard

```bash
# Show session status across all repos
acorn status

# Filter to a specific repo
acorn status myapp
```

Output columns:

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| REPO | Repository name |
| SLUG | Issue slug (e.g., `42-add-authentication`) |
| SESSION | `running` or `dead` |
| BACKEND | `tmux` or `dev` |
| STATUS | Lifecycle status label (or legacy fallback: `planning`/`review`/`unknown`) |
| ATTACH | Command to attach to a running session |

### Mark a spec as ready for review

After the planning pipeline has produced `plans/SPEC.md`:

```bash
acorn spec-complete myapp 42-add-authentication
```

This sets the GitHub label to `spec-review` and posts a review-ready comment.

### Approve a spec

After reviewing the generated `plans/SPEC.md`:

```bash
acorn approve myapp 42-add-authentication
```

This sets the GitHub label to `spec-approved` and posts an approval comment on the issue.

### Clean up a spec

```bash
# Interactive confirmation
acorn clean myapp 42-add-authentication

# Skip confirmation
acorn clean myapp 42-add-authentication --yes

# Also remove lifecycle + clarification labels from the issue
acorn clean myapp 42-add-authentication --remove-labels --yes

# Force delete even if SPEC.md exists and issue is still open
acorn clean myapp 42-add-authentication --force --yes
```

This kills the associated tmux session and deletes the spec directory.

**Safety check:** If `plans/SPEC.md` exists and the GitHub issue is still open, `clean` will refuse to delete the spec directory — this prevents accidental loss of generated specs before implementation. Use `--force` to override.

### Create a GitHub issue

By default, `acorn issue create` enters interactive mode and prompts for a structured template:

```bash
acorn issue create myapp "Add user authentication"
# Prompts for: Job Story, Promise, Constraints, Acceptance Criteria, Context
# All sections are optional — press Enter to skip
```

To bypass the template and provide the body directly:

```bash
acorn issue create myapp "Add user authentication" \
  --body "We need OAuth2 login with Google and GitHub providers" \
  --label "feature" \
  --assignee "username"
```

To create an issue with no body (skip template entirely):

```bash
acorn issue create myapp "Add user authentication" --raw
```

Options:
- `--body <text>` — Issue body text (bypasses interactive template)
- `--body-file <path>` — Read body from a file (bypasses interactive template)
- `--raw` — Skip the interactive template prompt
- `--label <name>` — Add a label (repeatable)
- `--assignee <login>` — Assign a user (repeatable)

#### Template sections

The interactive template collects five optional sections, optimized for AI spec generation:

| Section | Format | Purpose |
|---------|--------|---------|
| Job Story | "When [situation], I want [action], so I can [outcome]" | Captures problem, user, and motivation |
| Promise | "After this ships: [guarantee]" | Defines desired behavior as commitment |
| Constraints | Free text | What must not change, out of scope |
| Acceptance Criteria | Free text | Testable conditions proving promise is met |
| Context | Free text | Examples, links, prior art |

### Create an issue and start planning immediately

```bash
acorn issue plan myapp "Add user authentication"
# Interactive template prompts, then immediately starts spec generation

# With direct body (bypasses template)
acorn issue plan myapp "Add user authentication" \
  --body "We need OAuth2 login with Google and GitHub providers"

# With lite or quick mode
acorn issue plan myapp "Add user authentication" --lite
```

This combines `issue create` + `create` — it creates the GitHub issue and immediately starts spec generation.

### Mark an issue as human-clarified

```bash
acorn issue clarify myapp 42
# Output: Marked issue #42 in myapp as human-clarified and ready-for-spec
```

This swaps the clarification label from `ai-drafted` to `human-clarified` and transitions lifecycle from `triage` to `ready-for-spec` (without regressing issues already further along).

### Manually set lifecycle label

```bash
acorn issue label myapp 42 implementing
acorn issue label myapp 42 in-review
acorn issue label myapp 42 done
```

Use this when work advances outside the spec pipeline and you want labels to reflect actual state.

### Split an issue into sub-issues

```bash
acorn issue split myapp 42
```

Uses AI analysis (Claude Sonnet by default) to evaluate whether an issue should be decomposed into smaller, independently implementable sub-issues. If splitting is recommended:

1. Displays the analysis with rationale and proposed sub-issues
2. Asks for confirmation (or use `--yes` to skip)
3. Creates the sub-issues on GitHub
4. Posts a reference comment on the parent issue linking to the new sub-issues

Options:
- `--yes` — Skip confirmation prompt and create sub-issues automatically
- `--model <model>` — Override the AI model used for analysis (default: `claude-sonnet-4-5`)

```bash
# Auto-confirm sub-issue creation
acorn issue split myapp 42 --yes

# Use a different model for analysis
acorn issue split myapp 42 --model claude-opus-4-6
```

## GitHub Label Lifecycle

Acorn manages these labels automatically (creates them if they don't exist):

| Label | Set By | Meaning |
|-------|--------|---------|
| `triage` | `acorn issue create` | New issue awaiting clarification |
| `ready-for-spec` | `acorn issue clarify` | Clarified and ready for spec work |
| `spec-in-progress` | `acorn create` | Planning pipeline is running |
| `spec-review` | `acorn spec-complete` / `acorn issue label` | Spec is ready for review |
| `spec-approved` | `acorn approve` | Spec approved for implementation |
| `implementing` | `acorn issue label` | Implementation in progress |
| `in-review` | `acorn issue label` | Implementation/PR review in progress |
| `done` | `acorn issue label` | Work complete |

### Clarification Labels

These are orthogonal to lifecycle labels and indicate issue clarification status:

| Label | Set By | Meaning |
|-------|--------|---------|
| `ai-drafted` | `acorn issue create`, `acorn issue plan` | Issue was drafted by AI and needs human clarification |
| `human-clarified` | `acorn issue clarify` | Issue has been reviewed and clarified by a human |

## How the Planning Pipeline Works

The `PROMPT.md` generated by Acorn contains embedded instructions for the planning methodology (mode-dependent). When Claude Code reads it and you say "let's draft this", it orchestrates the pipeline.

### Full Pipeline (default)

6 stages, 14 sub-agent launches:

0. **Stage 0 — Codebase Reconnaissance**: 3 Opus sub-agents explore the actual codebase from different angles (architecture, relevant code, conventions)
1. **Stage 1 — Diverse Parallel Drafting**: 4 Opus sub-agents each independently draft a complete implementation plan with a distinct architectural lens (Minimal Surgery, Clean Architecture, Robustness-First, Developer Experience)
2. **Stage 2 — Rubric-Based Evaluation**: 1 Opus sub-agent scores all 4 drafts against a structured rubric
3. **Stage 3 — Weighted Synthesis**: 1 Opus sub-agent synthesizes a master plan using scored drafts
4. **Stage 4 — Adversarial Red Team**: 4 Opus sub-agents each attack the master plan from a different angle
5. **Stage 5 — Final Spec**: 1 Opus sub-agent produces `plans/SPEC.md` with traceability matrix and red team resolution log

### Lite Pipeline (`--lite`)

4 stages, 6 sub-agent launches:

0. **Stage 0 — Codebase Reconnaissance**: 3 Sonnet sub-agents (same recon as full)
1. **Stage 1 — Comprehensive Draft**: 1 Opus sub-agent drafts a single plan balancing all four architectural lenses
2. **Stage 2 — Combined Validation**: 1 Opus sub-agent performs requirements coverage, codebase fact-check, ambiguity audit, and edge case analysis
3. **Stage 3 — Final Spec**: 1 Opus sub-agent incorporates validation findings into `plans/SPEC.md`

### Quick Pipeline (`--quick`)

2 stages, 4 sub-agent launches:

0. **Stage 0 — Codebase Reconnaissance**: 3 Sonnet sub-agents (same recon as full)
1. **Stage 1 — Direct Spec**: 1 Opus sub-agent reads recon + requirements and produces `plans/SPEC.md` directly

### Orchestrator Design

The orchestrator agent's only job is to launch sub-agents and confirm completion — it never writes plan content itself. This keeps its context window clean while leveraging independent 200k-token contexts for thorough analysis.

### Image Extraction

When a GitHub issue contains images (screenshots, mockups, diagrams), `acorn create` automatically:

1. **Extracts** image URLs from the issue body and comments (`![alt](url)` syntax)
2. **Downloads** images to `.specs/<slug>/images/` with deterministic hash-based filenames
3. **Rewrites** the URLs in `PROMPT.md` to local paths so planning agents can view them

This means planning agents can actually **see** screenshots and mockups via Claude Code's Read tool, rather than just seeing markdown URL text. The Architecture recon agent (Stage 0) is specifically instructed to examine any images in the `images/` directory.

Supported formats: PNG, JPG, JPEG, GIF, WebP, SVG. GitHub asset UUID URLs (from drag-and-drop uploads) are also handled.

If a download fails, the original remote URL is preserved in PROMPT.md and the pipeline continues normally.

## Testing

```bash
# Run unit tests (no network calls to GitHub API)
bash test/test_images.sh
bash test/test_labels.sh
bash test/test_auto_trigger.sh
bash test/test_split.sh
bash test/test_dependencies.sh

# Run full suites including integration tests
# (creates temporary GitHub issues, verifies image/label flows, cleans up)
INTEGRATION=1 bash test/test_images.sh
INTEGRATION=1 bash test/test_labels.sh
```

## Troubleshooting

**"Missing required command(s): claude"**
Install Claude Code. See [Claude Code docs](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code).

**"Missing required command(s): gh"**
Install the GitHub CLI: `brew install gh` and authenticate with `gh auth login`.

**"Repo path not found: ~/Projects/myapp/main"**
Acorn expects your repo at `~/Projects/<repo>/main/` (or `~/projects/<repo>/main/`). Clone or move your repo there. If using cashew, `dev new <repo> <git-url>` sets this up automatically.

**"Failed to fetch issue #42"**
Make sure `gh` is authenticated and has access to the repo. Run `gh auth status` and check `gh issue view 42` from within the repo.

**Session doesn't start**
Ensure tmux is installed (`brew install tmux`).

**PROMPT.md already exists**
`acorn create` is idempotent — it won't overwrite an existing PROMPT.md. To regenerate, clean first: `acorn clean <repo> <slug> --force --yes` then re-run create.

**Auto-trigger doesn't fire**
The auto-trigger waits for Claude Code to be ready (polling for the prompt character) before sending the planning prompt via tmux. If it times out, attach to the session and send the trigger manually: say "let's draft this".
